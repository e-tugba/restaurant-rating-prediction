# 🍽️ Restaurant Customer Rating Prediction Project

A machine learning project to predict restaurant customer ratings using Python and Google Colab. This project explores the impact of key business features and applies multiple regression models to forecast customer satisfaction.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to predict restaurant ratings more accurately by analyzing various features such as:
- Number of votes
- Online order availability
- Table booking option
- Restaurant type, location, and cuisine
- Cost for two people
- Listing category (e.g., Buffet, Delivery)

With proper feature engineering and ensemble modeling, the goal is to help businesses make smarter decisions based on data-driven insights.

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Features
- Multiple Linear Regression
- XGBoost Regressor
- Weighted Ensemble Modeling (e.g., 30% Linear + 70% XGBoost)
- Feature Importance Analysis

## ⚖️ Model Performance Comparison

Model performances were evaluated using R² and RMSE metrics:

| Model               | R² Score | RMSE   |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| Linear Regression   | 0.45     | 0.31   |
| XGBoost             | 0.53     | 0.28   |
| Weighted Ensemble   | **0.57** | **0.27** |
